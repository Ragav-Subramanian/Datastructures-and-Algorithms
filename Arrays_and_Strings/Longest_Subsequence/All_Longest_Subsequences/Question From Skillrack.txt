The program must accept two string values A and B as the input. 
The program must print all the longest common subsequences of the two string values sorted in ascending order as the output.Common subsequence is a group of characters present in both the string values in same order.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= A, B <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains A.
The second line contains B.

Output Format:
The lines contain all the longest common subsequences of A and B.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
trigger
trireme

Output:
trie
trir

Explanation:
There are two longest common subsequences.
They are trie and trir which are printed as the output.
